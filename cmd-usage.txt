  Commands

    ssh:

    Prepend an ordinary SSH invocation with `0x -c` to 
    pipe stacks to your local machine and generate the
    flamegraph locally. This tends to result in faster
    flamegraph generation, prevents a production server
    from being under load and makes it easier to 
    access the flamegraph. 

    0x -c ssh [ssh args]
    0x --cmd ssh [ssh args]

    viz:

    The viz command will regenerate the flamegraph from
    a JSON or stacks.out file (autodetected)

    Recreate the flamegraph from the stacks JSON output 
    in the profile folder:

    0x -c viz [flags] <stacks.<pid>.json file>

    Flags include `--tiers` and `--langs`

    Create a flamegraph from a stacks file (e.g. dtrace
    and perf script output)

    0x -c viz [flags] <stacks.<pid>.out file>

    Flags include `--tiers` and `--langs`

    This file is also created in the profile folder
